      In collaboration with Liang Li (University of Electronic Science
      and   Technology  of   China,   Chengdu,  China)   and  Kun   Li
      (Southwestern  University  of  Finance and  Economics,  Chengdu,
      China), we study non-intrusive  reduced-order modeling (ROM) for
      parameterized   time-domain   electromagnetic   problems.    The
      considered  parameters are  the  electric  permittivity and  the
      temporal  variable.  Snapshot  vectors  are produced  by a  high
      order DGTD method formulated on an unstructured simplicial mesh.
      Because the second dimension of the snapshots matrix is large, a
      two-step or nested proper  orthogonal decomposition (POD) method
      is employed to extract time- and parameter-independent POD basis
      functions.   By using  the  singular  value decomposition  (SVD)
      method, the  principal components of the  projection coefficient
      matrices (also referred to  as the reduced coefficient matrices)
      of full-order solutions onto the reduced-basis (RB) subspace are
      extracted.  A cubic spline interpolation-based (CSI) approach is
      proposed to approximate the dominating time- and parameter-modes
      of  the  reduced  coefficient   matrices  without  resorting  to
      Galerkin projection.   The generation  of snapshot  vectors, the
      construction  of POD  basis functions  and the  approximation of
      reduced  coefficient  matrices  based  on  the  CSI  method  are
      completed during the offline stage.  The reduced basis solutions
      for new time  and parameter values can be  rapidly recovered via
      outputs from the  interpolation models in the  online stage.  In
      particular,  the  offline  and  online stages  of  the  proposed
      POD-CSI  method  are  completely decoupled,  which  ensures  the
      computational validity of the method.
