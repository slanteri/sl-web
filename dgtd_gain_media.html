      In laser physics,  gain or amplification is a  process where the
      medium   transfers   part  of   its   energy   to  an   incident
      electromagnetic radiation,  resulting in an increase  in optical
      power.    This   is  the   basic   principle   of  all   lasers.
      Quantitatively,  gain is  a measure  of the  ability of  a laser
      medium to increase optical power. Modeling optical gain requires
      to study the  interaction of the atomic structure  of the medium
      with the  incident electromagnetic wave.  Indeed,  electrons and
      their interactions with electromagnetic  fields are important in
      our  understanding of  chemistry and  physics. In  the classical
      view, the  energy of an  electron orbiting an atomic  nucleus is
      larger for orbits further from the nucleus of an atom.  However,
      quantum mechanical  effects force electrons to  take on discrete
      positions in  orbitals.  Thus,  electrons are found  in specific
      energy  levels of  an atom.   In a  semiclassical setting,  such
      transitions between atomic energy levels are generally described
      by the so-called rate equations.  These rate equations model the
      behavior  of  a  gain  material,  and they  need  to  be  solved
      self-consistently with the system of Maxwell equations.  So far,
      the  resulting  coupled  system of  Maxwell-rate  equations  has
      mostly been considered  in a time-domain setting  using the FDTD
      method for which  several extensions have been  proposed. In the
      context of  the PhD of  CÃ©dric Legrand, we study  an alternative
      numerical  modeling   approach  based  on  a   high  order  DGTD
      method. This novel DGTD method is formulated and analyzed in the
      three-dimensional case.
