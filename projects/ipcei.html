      The  IPCEI  (Important  Projects of  Common  European  Interest)
      project's overall  objective is  to enable research  and develop
      innovative technologies and  components (e.g.  chips, integrated
      circuits, and sensors) that can be  integrated in a large set of
      downstream  applications.  These  include consumer  devices, for
      example home  appliances and automated vehicles,  and commercial
      and industrial  devices, for example the  management systems for
      batteries  used for  electric mobility  and energy  storage.  In
      this   project,   we  are   a   third   party  partner   of   ST
      Microelectronics in  Crolles, and  are involved in  a subproject
      that  aims  at  exploiting  nanostructuring  for  improving  the
      performance  of  CMOS image  sensor  microlens  array.  In  this
      context, numerical  modeling is  a key component  for accurately
      characterizing the light absorption  properties of these complex
      structures, which are multiscale  by nature (from the micrometer
      scale of  the lens to  the nanometer features of  the structured
      layers).   The Finite  Difference Time-Domain  (FDTD) method  is
      often  adopted  in  the  first  instance  for  simulating  light
      interaction with such structures.  However, because it relies on
      a   Cartesian  grid,   its  adequacy   for  meshing   multiscale
      structures, including the curvature of the microlens (at a scale
      of  typically  a  micrometer)  as  well  as  the  nanostructured
      surfaces of the silicon buffer, is limited. In this context, our
      main objective  is to  assess the capabilities  of a  high order
      finite        element        type        time-domain        from
      the             <a             href="https://diogenes.inria.fr/"
      target="_blank">DIOGENeS</a> software  suite for  the simulation
      of nanoscale light-matter interaction problems involving complex
      structures  such  as those  of  interest  to the  image  sensing
      industry.
