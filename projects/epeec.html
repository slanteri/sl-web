      EPEECâ€™s main  goal is to  develop and deploy  a production-ready
      parallel   programming    environment   that    turns   upcoming
      overwhelmingly-heterogeneous   exascale    supercomputers   into
      manageable  platforms for  domain  application developers.   The
      consortium  will significantly  advance  and integrate  existing
      state-of-the-art   components  based   on  European   technology
      (programming  models,  runtime  systems,  and  tools)  with  key
      features   enabling  3   overarching  objectives:   high  coding
      productivity, high performance, and energy awareness.
