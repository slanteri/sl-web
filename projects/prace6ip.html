      PRACE, the  Partnership for Advanced Computing  is the permanent
      pan-European  High   Performance  Computing   service  providing
      world-class  systems for  world-class science.   Systems at  the
      highest  performance level  (Tier-0)  are  deployed by  Germany,
      France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, providing researchers with
      more than  17 billion core  hours of compute time.   HPC experts
      from 25 member  states enabled users from  academia and industry
      to  ascertain leadership  and remain  competitive in  the Global
      Race. The objectives of PRACE-6IP are to build on and seamlessly
      continue the  successes of  PRACE and  start new  innovative and
      collaborative  activities  proposed  by  the  consortium.  These
      include: assisting the development of PRACE 2; strengthening the
      internationally  recognised PRACE  brand; continuing  and extend
      advanced  training  which  so  far provided  more  than  36  400
      personÂ·training  days; preparing  strategies and  best practices
      towards   Exascale  computing,   work   on  forward-looking   SW
      solutions;  coordinating  and  enhancing the  operation  of  the
      multi-tier  HPC systems  and services;  and supporting  users to
      exploit massively parallel systems and novel architectures.
