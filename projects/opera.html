      In the  OPERA project, we  are investigating and  optimizing the
      properties  of planar  photonic  devices  based on  metasurfaces
      using  numerical   modelling.   The  scientific   and  technical
      activities  that  constitute  the  project  work  programme  are
      organized   around   4   main   workpackages.    The   numerical
      characterization  of the  optical properties  of planar  devices
      based on metasurfaces, as well  as their optimization are at the
      heart  of  the  activities  and  objectives  of  two  horizontal
      (transversal) workpackages.  These  numerical methodologies will
      be  integrated  into  the  <a  href="https://diogenes.inria.fr/"
      target="_blank">DIOGENeS</a>   software   framework  that   will
      eventually  integrates (1)  discontinuous Galerkin-type  methods
      that  have  been   tested  over  the  past  10   years  for  the
      discretization  of  Maxwell  equations  in  time  and  frequency
      regimes,  mainly for  applications  in the  microwave band,  (2)
      parallel resolution  algorithms for sparse linear  systems based
      on  the latest  developments  in numerical  linear algebra,  (3)
      modern   optimization   techniques   based   on   learning   and
      metamodeling  methods and  (4)  software  components adapted  to
      modern high  performance computing architectures.   Two vertical
      workpackages  complete this  program. Two  vertical workpackages
      complete  this program.   One of  them aims  to demonstrate  the
      contributions of methodological developments and numerical tools
      resulting   from   transversal    workpackages   through   their
      application  to diffusion/radiation  control  by passive  planar
      devices.   The other,  more prospective,  concerns the  study of
      basic  building blocks  for the  realization of  adaptive planar
      devices.
