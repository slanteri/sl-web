      Numerical  simulations   of  electromagnetic   wave  propagation
      problems   primarily   rely    on   spatially   and   temporally
      discretization of  the system  of time-domain  Maxwell equations
      using  finite difference  or finite  element type  methods.  For
      complex  and  realistic  three-dimensional  situations,  such  a
      process can  be computationally prohibitive, especially  in view
      of   many-query   analyses   (e.g.,  optimization   design   and
      uncertainty     quantification).       Therefore,     developing
      cost-effective   surrogate   models   is  of   great   practical
      significance.   Among  the  different  possible  approaches  for
      building  a  surrogate  model  of   a  given  PDE  system  in  a
      non-intrusive  way  (i.e.,  with  minimal  modifications  to  an
      existing    discretization-based     simulation    methodology),
      approaches based on  neural networks and Deep  Learning (DL) has
      recently shown new promises due  to their capability of handling
      nonlinear or/and high dimensional problems.  In this context, we
      study  if the  recently introduced  concept of  Physics-Informed
      Neural  Networks  (PINNs)  can   provide  a  fast  and  accurate
      surrogate model of time-domain electromagnetic wave propagation.
