      We develop  the DIOGENeS software  suite, which is  dedicated to
      computational nanophotonics. DIOGENeS is  a comprehensive set of
      numerical tools for  geometrical modelling, characterization and
      inverse  design   of  nanoscale  devices.   For   the  numerical
      characterization of nanoscale light-matter interactions, we rely
      on high order finite element type full-wave solvers based on the
      Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. A choice can be made between
      time-domain   (DGTD)   and  frequency-domain   (HDGFD)   solvers
      depending on  the problem  at hand.   Various types  of sources,
      material laws and observables  are available. An object-oriented
      programming   architecture    is   adopted   and    a   parallel
      implementation allows  to consider  large problems  on dedicated
      cluster-like  architectures.  For  inverse  design  studies,  we
      exploit statistical learning global optimization strategies.
