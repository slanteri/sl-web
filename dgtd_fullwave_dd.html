      In the  field of semiconductor physics  modeling, charge carrier
      transport is the starring phenomenon  that needs to be predicted
      in order  to build a  mathematical model, based  on higher-level
      quantities  (e.g.  electric  current and  voltage), that  can be
      practically   used  for   device  simulation.    Charge  carrier
      transport  is generally  described by  a drift-diffusion  model.
      This yields  a system of coupled  partial differential equations
      which   can   be  solved   at   two   levels:  (1)   quasistatic
      approximation:  the external  force  applied to  the crystal  is
      electrostatic, and  drift-diffusion equations  are coupled  to a
      Poisson equation  for the electrostatic potential.   The goal is
      to determine the spatial  distribution of carrier concentrations
      and  the  electric  field  (deduced  from  the  potential);  (2)
      fullwave   model:  the   crystal  is   subject  to   an  applied
      electromagnetic field,  and Maxwell  equations are  coupled with
      transport  equations  for  carrier  dynamics.  The  goal  is  to
      determine the space-time evolution of carrier concentrations and
      the  electromagnetic field.   The  quasistatic approximation  is
      rigorous when  the steady state  of the semiconductor has  to be
      calculated.  For  example, this could  be a preliminary  step to
      the  fullwave simulation  of a  device that  is biased  prior to
      responding to a  (time-varying) electromagnetic excitation.  The
      fullwave model is particularly  relevant to electro-optics, i.e.
      when  light-matter interaction  is  investigated.  Indeed,  such
      study is essential to  understanding and accurately modeling the
      operation of photonic devices  for light generation, modulation,
      absorption.  With St√©phane  Descombes and in the  context of the
      PhD of Massimiliano Montone we have a designed a DGTD method for
      solving   the   coupled   system  of   Maxwell   equations   and
      drift-diffusion equations  in the fullwave setting.   The method
      has been formulated in the general three-dimensional case, and a
      computer implementation  has been realized in  a two-dimensional
      setting.
